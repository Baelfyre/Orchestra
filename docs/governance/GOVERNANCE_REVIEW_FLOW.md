# Governance Review Flow

Every request passes through this flow before execution begins. Review depth scales to project risk and the active operating mode.

## Governance Strictness Derivation Note

Governance strictness is derived from the highest applicable trigger, not from a new input field. `Operating Mode` identifies task intent, while `Release Stage` identifies lifecycle state. The flow below does not change: the derived strictness only explains why a given request stays on a lightweight path or escalates to stricter governance depth.

```text
Governance Strictness Level = max(applicable mode baseline, release trigger, risk trigger, compliance/data trigger, continuity trigger)
```

## Fast Path (LOW Risk)

For trivial or low-risk requests:
- Steward returns `NOT_APPLICABLE` or lightweight `APPROVED`.
- Governor returns `NOT_APPLICABLE` or lightweight `APPROVED`.
- Conductor proceeds immediately.
- Governance adds near-zero token overhead.

## Continuity Path

Arbiter runs only when continuation safety is uncertain:
- interrupted task
- token or context exhaustion risk
- branch switch or divergence
- workspace or IDE transition
- unclear source of truth
- failed or missing validation
- handoff
- merge or pull request preparation

Arbiter returns `READY`, `READY_WITH_MINOR_FIXES`, `HOLD`, or `BLOCKED`. `HOLD` and `BLOCKED` pause continuation until the required evidence, validation, or remediation is complete.

## Standard Path (MEDIUM Risk)

- Steward checks scope, requirements, acceptance criteria.
- Governor checks license compat, basic privacy, attribution.
- Compact output format used.

## Expanded Path (HIGH Risk)

- Steward checks full alignment, stakeholders, traceability, roadmap.
- Governor checks full compliance, ToS/PP, human review flag.
- Expanded output format used when findings exist.

## Release Path

- Release Mode includes final release-gate review before public release, client delivery, production deployment, app store submission, or open-source distribution.
- For app release workflows, The Governor must review the [App Release Compliance Gate](APP_RELEASE_COMPLIANCE_GATE.md).
- Missing required privacy, data inventory, retention, deletion, account deletion documentation when accounts exist, platform disclosures, or IP clearance artifacts must return `REVISION_REQUIRED` or `BLOCKED`, depending on release context and severity.
- Release Mode is task intent. `production` is release-stage state. They are related inputs, but they are not synonyms.

## Re-submission

When `REVISION_REQUIRED`:
1. Address all findings.
2. Fill documentation gaps.
3. Re-submit for review.
4. Review restarts from the authority that issued the revision.

## Missing Context

When project context is incomplete:
```
DECISION: REVISION_REQUIRED
REASON: Project context incomplete.
REQUIRED_ACTIONS: [Provide project type, release target, data collection status]
```
The system does not default to HIGH-risk assumptions for unknown projects.

## Delegated Execution Flow (Phase B Implemented & Locally Validated)

The following flow describes the behavior for delegated autonomous
governance. Phase B instruction-level behavior is implemented and locally validated;
remote and host reliability remain pending until separately authorized.


```
Phase envelope approved by human
  ->  Internal unit execution begins
  ->  Unit work performed within envelope boundaries
  ->  Focused evidence collected (validation commands, scope audit, security check)
  ->  Arbiter transition evaluation
        APPROVED + evidence current + no gate  ->  AUTO_CONTINUE
        Deterministic in-scope defect + budget remains  ->  AUTO_REMEDIATE_AND_REVALIDATE
        Missing or stale evidence  ->  WAIT_FOR_EVIDENCE
        Insufficient host capacity  ->  WAIT_FOR_CAPACITY
        Missing intent, scope change, policy, or contradiction  ->  ESCALATE_HUMAN
        Unsafe or prohibited condition  ->  STOP
  ->  On AUTO_CONTINUE: checkpoint produced, next unit begins
  ->  On WAIT_*: resumable state held, no new approval required
  ->  On ESCALATE_HUMAN: human decision obtained, phase resumes or is revised
  ->  On STOP: phase halts, human review required

All approved units accepted
  ->  Phase validation gate runs
  ->  PHASE_READY_FOR_HUMAN_REVIEW returned
```

Current behavior (before Phase B) uses the standard flow documented in this
file, where each significant decision point involves a human prompt. The
governance specialist and Arbiter re-entry rules in `GOVERNANCE_LAYER.md`
apply in both the current and target flows.

See `docs/governance/DELEGATED_EXECUTION_POLICY.md` for the canonical contract
and `docs/project/DELEGATED_GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the
multi-phase implementation roadmap.
